# Web Scraping Presidential Vocabulary

![alt text](https://www.dataschool.io/content/images/2017/07/article_1.png)

On July 21, 2017, the New York Times updated an opinion article called **Trump's Lies**, detailing every public lie the President has told since taking office. Because this is a newspaper, the information was (of course) published as a block of text. This is a great format for human consumption, but it can't easily be understood by a computer. I chose this project because it presented a good oppotunity to work on my webscraping skills 

This project has been done by others in the data science community as well.
