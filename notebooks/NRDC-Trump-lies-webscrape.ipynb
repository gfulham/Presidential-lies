       "<p>Scientists are unequivocal on this point: Climate change isn’t “going back.” It will never reverse itself. We can only limit how much and how fast the climate changes by reversing the thing that’s driving the change in the first place: <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/stories/global-warming-101\">heat-trapping greenhouse gas pollution</a> in our atmosphere, largely from the burning of fossil fuels. We have to reduce those emissions dramatically in the next 10 years and reach net-zero emissions by 2050, primarily by shifting to clean energy and by protecting and enhancing the natural ecosystems that remove those pollutants from the air. Emissions from industry, transportation, and other human activities since the beginning of the 19th century are driving far more rapid climate change than any <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/climateqa/if-earth-has-warmed-and-cooled-throughout-history-what-makes-scientists-think-that-humans-are-causing-global-warming-now/\">natural variations</a> in the earth’s warming and cooling cycles, which occur over thousands and thousands of years—not one or two centuries. </p>\n",
       "<p>Even the government’s own scientists agree. The U.S. government signed the <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/experts/roland-hwang/ipcc-report-isnt-death-knell-its-wake-call\">recent report</a> from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which urges drastic action to contain the man-made—and rapidly approaching—climate catastrophe. And in the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/03/climate/document-Climate-Science-Special-Report-2017.html\">National Climate Assessment Report</a>, approved by the White House and released last November, federal officials specifically discount theories on natural cycles, saying they “find no convincing evidence that natural variability can account for the amount of global warming observed over the industrial era.” In other words, we shouldn’t hold our breath for a miracle reversal.</p>\n",
       "<p>And for the record: If you deny both the cause (people) and the future projections (bleak) of climate change, then yes, you are a climate change denier. </p>\n",

The Trump administration uses this lie to <u><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/8/21/17763916/epa-clean-power-plan-affordable-clean-energy\">justify rollbacks</a></u> that favor big polluters—and the president’s political cronies—all while pushing us closer to climate catastrophe.</p>\n",
       "<p>In fact, energy efficiency is <em><a href=\"https://www.e2.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018-EE-Jobs-Report.pdf\">the fastest-growing job sector</a></em> in the energy industry—employing twice as many workers as all U.S. fossil fuel sectors <em>combined</em>. According to the <a href=\"https://www.e2.org/cleanjobsamerica/\">latest report by E2</a>, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for environmentally and economically smart policies, clean energy jobs now employ 3.2 million Americans. (At last count, Trump’s beloved coal industry employed<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/03/31/8-surprisingly-small-industries-that-employ-more-people-than-coal/?utm_term=.adf059c7116d\"> 76,000.)</a></p>\n",
       "<p>But that President Trump willfully ignores is that unmitigated climate change will cost us far, far more.</p><p>When Trump backed out of the Paris Agreement, he cited lost revenue and 2.7 million lost American jobs (numbers that appear to have come from pro-industry<a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/assets/2017/03/16/document_gw_02.pdf\"> think tanks</a>). But <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0071-9\">recent research</a> out of Stanford University concluded that meeting our Paris Agreement goals would actually save the world tens of trillions of dollars, far outweighing the costs. Similar cost-benefit analysis also supports other <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/experts/simon-mui/new-study-shows-strong-standards-produce-jobs-cleaner-cars\">Obama-era climate policies</a>—though that hasn’t slowed the Trump administration’s race to reverse them.</p><p>Perhaps most troubling is that Trump’s argument doesn’t account for the incalculable <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/experts/david-doniger/trumps-dirty-power-plan-means-hell-earth\">human suffering</a> caused by climate change—something that should count more than the financial bottom line.</p>\n",

At the time of President Trump’s tweet, hundreds of residents were still missing.</p>\n",
       "<p>The Camp Fire is one of the many fires that have been plaguing the West Coast year-round. Trump was quick to pin the November blazes on California’s forest management practices, but that’s misleading.</p>\n",
       "<p>State and local agencies own <a href=\"https://ucanr.edu/sites/forestry/California_forests/\">only 3 percent</a> of the state’s forests. The majority—57 percent—belongs to the U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Department of the Interior, so the federal government would be hard-pressed to pass off the blame.</p>\n",
       "<p>Trump appears to be making the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/us/politics/fact-check-trump-california-fire-tweet.html\">flawed case for more industrial logging</a>, arguing that it thins out forests and slows the pace of fires once they start. (Interior Secretary <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/08/08/active-forest-management-prevent-wildfires-column/913801002/\">Ryan Zinke</a> has echoed this position.) But logging would just get rid of large, fire-resistant trees, leaving behind the highly flammable brush, bushes, and twigs as tinder.</p>\n",
       "<p>In calling out forest management, Trump is also ignoring the elephant in the room: climate change. Climate change may not start the wildfires, but it creates conditions in which they are <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/stories/pacific-northwest-testing-out-new-wildfire-defenses-front-lines\">more frequent and more destructive</a>. The higher temperatures caused by global warming extend the fire season and supply plenty of dry, fire-prone forest. In fact, July 2018 was California’s <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/there-s-no-more-typical-wildfire-season-california-it-may-n934521\">hottest month on record</a>. In the Pacific Northwest, climate change also causes something called <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/onearth/year-without-snow\">wet drought</a>, which occurs when warmer winter temperatures turn what would typically be snow into rain, reducing the high-altitude snowpack. When spring comes, there is less melting snow to provide moisture and surface water, leaving these states to face a long, dry summer.</p>\n",

    "<p>Scientists are unequivocal on this point: Climate change isn’t “going back.” It will never reverse itself. We can only limit how much and how fast the climate changes by reversing the thing that’s driving the change in the first place: <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/stories/global-warming-101\">heat-trapping greenhouse gas pollution</a> in our atmosphere, largely from the burning of fossil fuels. We have to reduce those emissions dramatically in the next 10 years and reach net-zero emissions by 2050, primarily by shifting to clean energy and by protecting and enhancing the natural ecosystems that remove those pollutants from the air. Emissions from industry, transportation, and other human activities since the beginning of the 19th century are driving far more rapid climate change than any <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/climateqa/if-earth-has-warmed-and-cooled-throughout-history-what-makes-scientists-think-that-humans-are-causing-global-warming-now/\">natural variations</a> in the earth’s warming and cooling cycles, which occur over thousands and thousands of years—not one or two centuries. </p>\n",
    "<p>Even the government’s own scientists agree. The U.S. government signed the <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/experts/roland-hwang/ipcc-report-isnt-death-knell-its-wake-call\">recent report</a> from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which urges drastic action to contain the man-made—and rapidly approaching—climate catastrophe. And in the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/03/climate/document-Climate-Science-Special-Report-2017.html\">National Climate Assessment Report</a>, approved by the White House and released last November, federal officials specifically discount theories on natural cycles, saying they “find no convincing evidence that natural variability can account for the amount of global warming observed over the industrial era.” In other words, we shouldn’t hold our breath for a miracle reversal.</p>\n",
    "<p>And for the record: If you deny both the cause (people) and the future projections (bleak) of climate change, then yes, you are a climate change denier. </p>\n",
